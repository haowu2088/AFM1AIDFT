This repository contains the code, scripts, and data lists used in the paper:  
**"AI-predicted PT-symmetric magnets" (Hao Wu and Daniel F. Agterberg, 2025).**

---

We use an **established AI+DFT workflow** as a **tool** to identify PT-symmetric odd-parity AFM1 candidates and analyze their potential emergent responses.  

- We do **not** propose a new machine-learning method.
- All AI training and inference code is identical to the MIT-licensed implementation by Gao *et al.* ([MatAltMag](https://github.com/zfgao66/MatAltMag)). We include it here only for completeness and reproducibility. This repository differs from Gao *et al.*â€™s code primarily in **AFM1-specific dataset preparation** and in the inclusion of **DFT automation (ASE + QE) scripts**.
