This repository contains the code, scripts, and data lists used in the paper:  
**"AI-predicted PT-symmetric magnets" (Hao Wu and Daniel F. Agterberg, 2025).**

---

We use an **established AI+DFT workflow** as a **tool** to identify PT-symmetric odd-parity AFM1 candidates and analyze their potential emergent responses.  

- We do **not** propose a new machine-learning method.  
- Most of the AI training and inference code is essentially a copy of the MIT-licensed implementation by Gao *et al.* ([MatAltMag](https://github.com/zfgao66/MatAltMag)), with only very minor modifications for convenience and readability. We include it here to provide a complete and reproducible package for this work.  
- This repository differs from Gao *et al.*â€™s code primarily in **AFM1-specific dataset preparation** and in the inclusion of **DFT automation (ASE + QE)** scripts.
