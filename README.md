This repository contains the code, scripts, and data lists used in the paper:  
**"AI-predicted PT-symmetric magnets" (Hao Wu and Daniel F. Agterberg, 2025).**

This is a *materials & physics* repository.  
We use an **established AI+DFT workflow** as a **tool** to identify PT-symmetric odd-parity AFM1 candidates and analyze their potential emergent responses.  

- We do **not** propose a new machine-learning method.  
- Most of the AI training and inference code is essentially a copy of the MIT-licensed implementation by Gao *et al.* ([MatAltMag](https://github.com/zfgao66/MatAltMag)), with only very minor modifications for convenience and readability. We include it here to provide a complete and reproducible package for this work.  
- Our substantive contributions are in **AFM1-specific dataset preparation** (negative sample construction) and **DFT automation (ASE + QE)**, leading to **new AFM1 material candidates** and their physical analysis.
