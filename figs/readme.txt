finetune_loss_from_log.csv is extracted from logs/out_0.log
finetune_loss_iter.png is plotted using finetune_loss_from_log.csv
pretrain_loss_0.csv is transformed from out/loss_0.npy
pretrain_loss_curve.png is plotted using pretrain_loss_0.csv

There was no code line for plotting the fine-tuning loss curve in the original code; the curve was plotted using data extracted from logs/out_0.log.
