structure.py constructs magnetic configurations using the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE).
visualize.py gives a visualization of all the magnetic configurations of all the materials.
qe_test.py is the main DFT calculation script.
qe_test_u.py is the DFT+U script.

Line 53 of qe_test.py and line 60 of qe_test_u.py need an API key for Materials Project.
